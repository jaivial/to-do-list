## Key Features Implementation

### Authentication Flow

The application uses NextAuth.js for authentication with a custom credentials provider. User data is stored in PostgreSQL and managed through Prisma ORM.

### Todo Management

Todos are managed through a context provider (`TodoContext`) that handles state and communicates with the backend API. The application implements optimistic updates for a responsive user experience.

### Drag and Drop

Task reordering is implemented using @hello-pangea/dnd, allowing users to:
- Reorder tasks within the same section
- Move tasks between pending and completed sections
- Persist order changes to the database

### Internationalization

The application supports multiple languages through a custom `LanguageContext` that loads translations from JSON files and persists language preferences in localStorage.
